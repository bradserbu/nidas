Signals
-------
This is a simple example demonstrating use of the SeaMAC device driver to
read and write the available modem control signals.  This is an
interactive CLI utility that will poll the status of the signals
continuously.

Events
------
This is a simple example demonstrating use of the SeaMAC device driver to
monitor the available modem control signals.  This is a monitoring utility
that will wait for an event and then determine which signal(s) changed state.
NOTE: The hardware type requires interrupt support for this feature (ie 9198).

$ ./signals /dev/ttySM0
$ ./events /dev/ttySM0
